        description:
          "Have you ever wondered what it takes to go from an IDE to just vim?  These are the two simple steps it takes to go from an IDE to VIM.  From VS Code to Vim.  From Intellij To Vim.\n\nOn a serious note, this is actually just a remake of a joke that was made on stream.  Someone asked what it takes to go from an ide to just vim so I explained the really simple set of instructions but went on for quite some time.\n\n### Links\nLinode: https://linode.com/prime - $100 of free hosting on Linode\nTwitch: https://twitch.tv/ThePrimeagen\nInsta: https://instagram.com/ThePrimeagen\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen\nVimRC & i3: https://github.com/erkrnt/awesome-streamerrc/tree/master/ThePrimeagen\nKeyboard (15% off, I don't earn commission): https://bit.ly/primeagen-adv2 \nDue to Covid-19 You can buy Kinesis Here: https://amzn.to/3d8fgVf (no 15% off , SORRY) \n\n#vim #neovim #rustSucks",

The contestant then chooses the other boxes, one at a time, to be opened and removed from play. Throughout the game, the player is offered an amount of money to quit, being asked, "Deal or no deal?" If the contestant rejects every deal and eliminates all the other boxes, the player keeps the money that was in their original case or box. The contestant "wins" depending on whether the player should have taken one of the deals or should have held onto the original case or box until the very end.\n\n• 2ND CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/MoreSidemen\n• Sidemen Clothing: http://www.sidemenclothing.com\nLet us know some other video ideas you want us to do!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSidemen:\n● Miniminter: http://www.youtube.com/Miniminter\n● Zerkaa: http://www.youtube.com/Zerkaa\n● Behzinga: http://www.youtube.com/Behzinga\n● Vikkstar123: http://www.youtube.com/Vikkstar123\n● TBJZL: http://www.youtube.com/TBJZL\n● Wroetoshaw: http://www.youtube.com/Wroetoshaw\n● KSI: http://www.youtube.com/KSI',

          'SIDEMEN & 2 GUESTS PLAY DEAL OR NO DEAL FOR CHARITY #SidemenSunday\n• DONATE HERE: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/sdmn\n• SIDEMEN FC Tickets: http://www.sidemenfc.com\n\nGUESTS: \n• Callux: http://www.youtube.com/Callux\n• Jme: http://www.twitter.com/JmeBBK\n\nRules:\n\nThe player claims one box at the start of the game, without its contents being revealed. The contestant then chooses the other boxes, one at a time, to be opened and removed from play. Throughout the game, the player is offered an amount of money to quit, being asked, "Deal or no deal?" If the contestant rejects every deal and eliminates all the other boxes, the player keeps the money that was in their original case or box. The contestant "wins" depending on whether the player should have taken one of the deals or should have held onto the original case or box until the very end.\n\n• 2ND CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/MoreSidemen\n• Sidemen Clothing: http://www.sidemenclothing.com\nLet us know some other video ideas you want us to do!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSidemen:\n● Miniminter: http://www.youtube.com/Miniminter\n● Zerkaa: http://www.youtube.com/Zerkaa\n● Behzinga: http://www.youtube.com/Behzinga\n● Vikkstar123: http://www.youtube.com/Vikkstar123\n● TBJZL: http://www.youtube.com/TBJZL\n● Wroetoshaw: http://www.youtube.com/Wroetoshaw\n● KSI: http://www.youtube.com/KSI',
